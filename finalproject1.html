<div class="card-body">Insight 1:
It is clear from the visualization there is a significant amount of grographical disparity related to overall medal count. Wealthier countries appear, for the most part, to hold a dominant position in terms of total mdeal count. This suggests a possible correlation between economic development and success in the Olympics which would require further analysis.
Insight 2:
There are a few nations, notably the United States and Russia among other western European countries which appear toi dominate in medal count. Surprisingly, some of the smaller countries in Europe appear to be pretty small and I would assume hold a much smaller total population than the USA. These countries may have better infrastructure for athletes or maybe just have been involved with the Olympics for a longer period of time than other nations.
Insight 3:
This visualization reveals a large number of countries across the world participate in the Olympics and have won medals doing so. This speaks to the global nature of the Olympics and also invites questions as to why some nations have been unsuccessful in medal accumulation.</div>
